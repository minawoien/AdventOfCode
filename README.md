# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I have used dotnet (C#) in 2022 to further develop my skills in this programming language. The repository contains a folder for each day with its task and my solution to it.
